# Italy Tour Guide — Claude Code project notes

## What this is

Personal audio + text tour guide PWA for Abhishek and his wife's trip to Italy (Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples / Pompeii). Two users total — no auth, just a public URL.

## Architecture

Intentionally minimal — **two separate halves**:

1. **`content-gen/`** — Python pipeline, run locally before the trip. Reads hand-written tour scripts, runs them through edge-tts for narration, pulls photos from Wikimedia Commons, emits `manifest.json` + MP3s + JPGs.
2. **`app/`** — Plain HTML/CSS/JS PWA. **No build step, no node_modules, no bundler.** ES modules load directly in the browser. Service worker pre-caches everything for offline use.

This split is deliberate: the heavy work happens once, locally. The deployed app is just static files — no backend, no runtime API calls, no keys to leak.

**Scripts are hand-written, not LLM-generated.** Earlier iterations used Google Gemini; that's gone. Abhishek's preference for free + simple drove the pivot, and the LLM-free version is what's in the repo. If you're asked to add a chapter, write the text directly in `content-gen/scripts/{city}/{site}/{chapter}.txt`. Tone target lives in `prompts/system.txt` as a reference for *what to imitate*, not as a runtime prompt.

## Tech stack (and why)

- **Python (Anaconda base env)** for content gen — Abhishek already has it. Use `/Users/abhishekbhansali/anaconda3/bin/python3` explicitly; PATH may not have it in non-interactive shells.
- **edge-tts** for TTS — same Microsoft neural voices as Azure Speech but free via the public Edge endpoint. Default voice: `en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural`.
- **Wikimedia Commons** for photos — filtered to CC / Public Domain licenses. **Photo queries must be 1–2 words** (e.g. `"Pantheon"`, not `"Pantheon Rome interior oculus"`) or the search returns nothing CC-licensed. Photo downloads require a browser-like User-Agent — `upload.wikimedia.org` 403s "generic" UAs. Both gotchas are already baked into `generate.py`.
- **Plain HTML + ES modules** for the PWA — no build tool needed. Even though Node is installed (`/opt/homebrew/bin/node`), we don't use it for this project.
- **Netlify Drop / Vercel / GitHub Pages** for deploy — all free tier.

**Total cost: $0.** Stay there. If a future change requires a paid service, push back and look for a free alternative first.

## Common commands

All Python commands use the Anaconda Python explicitly to avoid PATH confusion:

```bash
# Generate one site (smoke test)
cd content-gen
/Users/abhishekbhansali/anaconda3/bin/python3 generate.py --site rome/pantheon

# Generate everything (idempotent)
/Users/abhishekbhansali/anaconda3/bin/python3 generate.py

# Force regen
/Users/abhishekbhansali/anaconda3/bin/python3 generate.py --force

# Copy generated content into the repo root for deploy
/Users/abhishekbhansali/anaconda3/bin/python3 copy_to_app.py

# Serve the app locally (from project root)
cd ..
/Users/abhishekbhansali/anaconda3/bin/python3 -m http.server 8000

# Deploy: just push
git add -A && git commit -m "Update content" && git push
```

```

**Deployment:** the repo is `abhibhansali.github.io` (a GitHub user-pages repo). GitHub Pages auto-serves the root of the `main` branch at `https://abhibhansali.github.io/`. Workflow: `git push` = live in ~30 seconds. No build step, no CI.

## Conventions to preserve

- **No build step.** ES modules use `.js` extensions in import paths so browsers can resolve them. Don't add a bundler unless there's a strong reason.
- **No backend.** The deployed app is 100% static.
- **No auth.** Abhishek explicitly removed the passcode gate — the app is open. Don't re-add a login layer (Entra ID, OAuth, passcode) unless he asks for one. The audio is not sensitive.
- **No runtime LLM.** Scripts are hand-written `.txt` files in `content-gen/scripts/`. Don't introduce runtime or build-time LLM calls — they break offline use, add ongoing cost, and reintroduce a dependency Abhishek explicitly removed (free tier issues with his org Google account triggered the pivot).
- **Cache versioning.** `install.js` keys offline cache by `manifest.generatedAt`. When you regenerate content, the version changes and clients re-download. Don't break this.
- **Service worker scope.** SW is at `/sw.js` and handles `/content/*` cache-first, JS/CSS network-first, navigations network-first. The cache name (`tg-shell-vN`) needs bumping when you break wire format. Keep the SW at the root.
- **`?nosw` escape hatch.** `index.html` recognizes `?nosw` in the URL and unregisters any service worker, wipes caches, and reloads. Use this when debugging stuck-cache issues. Don't remove.
- **Idempotent generation.** `generate.py` skips MP3s and photos that exist on disk unless `--force`. Preserve this — it makes iteration fast and avoids rate-limit issues with Wikimedia.

## Things NOT to do

- Don't add `npm install` / `package.json` / `vite.config.js` back to `app/` — we deliberately stripped them.
- Don't commit MP3s, JPGs, or `manifest.json` to git — they're large and regeneratable. `.gitignore` already excludes them.
- Don't put real secrets in the passcode or the deployed JS. The hash is visible to anyone who views source.
- Don't switch back to paid Azure / OpenAI services. Free stack is a hard requirement.

## Deploying

Three free options (in order of friction):

1. **Netlify Drop** — drag `app/` into [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). No CLI install. Easiest for one-off deploys.
2. **GitHub Pages** — push the repo, set Pages source to `/app`. Good if you want versioning.
3. **Vercel** — connect the GitHub repo via the web UI, root dir = `app`, framework = Other, no build command.

Service workers require HTTPS — all three options provide HTTPS for free. Local dev on `localhost` is allowed without HTTPS.

## Trip dates / status

- Trip cities: Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples / Pompeii
- Ticketed attractions: Colosseum, Vatican Museums, Milan Cathedral (Duomo), Pompeii
- Walking-only stops: Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona
- Decisions made (see `~/.claude/plans/cheeky-snuggling-torvalds.md` for full plan):
  - Single warm narrator (default: `en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural`)
  - Multi-chapter format (4–6 chapters per major site, ~15–25 min total)
  - Photos + practical tips for major sites
  - Manual site selection (no GPS)

## When working in this repo

If asked to add features:
- **Adding a site:** add an entry to `content-gen/sites.yaml`, write the chapter `.txt` files under `content-gen/scripts/{city}/{site}/`, then `python generate.py && python copy_to_app.py`. Photo queries should be 1–2 words.
- **Editing wording of an existing chapter:** edit the `.txt` file in `content-gen/scripts/{city}/{site}/`, delete the matching `.mp3` in `content-gen/output/{city}/{site}/`, re-run `generate.py`. Only the changed chapter regenerates.
- **Changing voice:** edit `TTS_VOICE` in `content-gen/.env`, then `python generate.py --force` (or delete the `.mp3` files first to keep scripts).
- **Changing tone for new writing:** edit `prompts/system.txt` for your own reference — but you (Claude) are the one writing the new chapters; the file isn't fed to anything at runtime.
- **Visual tweaks:** edit `app/styles.css`. The color palette uses terracotta (`#7a2e1f`) + cream (`#fdf6ec`) + Playfair Display / Inter — Italian-themed, not corporate.

Chapter writing style (lifted from `prompts/system.txt`): 350–450 words, conversational, present-tense, concrete details, no clichés. Address them as "you". Don't open with "Welcome to" or "step back in time". Don't end with "Enjoy your visit." Spell out numbers under twenty; say "seventy-nine A.D." not "79 AD".

If asked to add real authentication or move off free services: stop and confirm with Abhishek first. The free + simple constraint is load-bearing.
